# Sergey - Netlify

Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to site atop your already brilliant HTML. In essence, Sergey is HTML + partials with slots thrown in for good measure.

This is a starter project that'll deploy to Netlify on your behalf. It demonstrates the two key features of Sergey: imports, and slots.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install

# Build the site
$ npm start

# Run Sergey in dev mode
$ npm run dev
```
